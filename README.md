# first-REACT-app
Created with CodeSandbox
# This is the app that created as part of the course on udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course
It introduced me to some simple yet importan things that make react so popular and robust such as  
# - dynamic changing of the page with ES6 Javascript, state and hooks and other.
This is not my project, it was created for educational purpuses only.
